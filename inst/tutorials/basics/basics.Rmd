## R is 'just' and advanced calculator

R can output simple math by just putting it in the console or in a script and run it. We can use the ordinary math operators (+, -, *, /, ^) to add, subtract, etc. For example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
1 + 2^2
```

However, calculating with raw numbers is not very useful. We can instead assign values to *variables* and work with them. To assign a value we use the operator `<-`

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- 1
b <- 2
a + b^b
```

#### Exercise 1

Try assigning the value 2 to two different variables and add them together. Save the results as a new variable and print it.

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r twoplustwo, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5} 

```

```{r twoplustwo-hint}
a <- 
b <- 
c <- 
c
```

```{r twoplustwo-solution}
a <- 2
b <- 2
c <- a + b
c
```

## Vectors and variable types

A vector is a common way of storing a list of similar objects. We can assign vectors, just like for single numbers. We can do math with vectors. We can add or remove elements, or select parts of a vector.

### Exercise 2
The code below uses the `c()` function to create a vector of integers. We then add `10` to the vector, and as you can see, `10` is added to each element in the vector. We can apply other math operators to vectors aswell.

We can assign vectors in many ways, manually as below, or using other built-in functions in R. One example is the `seq()` function that generates a sequence of numbers. Assign a sequence from 1 to 5 by assigning `seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1)` to `vec_b` and add it to `vec_a`. Check that the result is what you expect.

```{r vectors, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
vec_a <- c(1, 8, 0, 2, 6)
vec_a + 10
```

```{r vectors-solution}
vec_a <- c(1, 8, 0, 2, 6)
vec_b <- seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1)
vec_a + vec_b
```

### Variable types
The numbers we have worked with so far are *integers*. R knows how to handle other types of data. The following are the ones you will commonly encounter:

* Integer (e.g. 1, 3, 100, 739)
* Numeric (3.14, 25.9, 108.928)
* Character ("name", "test") - note that characters are always in quotes
* Logical (TRUE, FALSE)

The distinction is important. Vectors can only contain objects of a single type, and trying to mix them can cause problems.

R has a set of functions for converting variable types if necessary. You could e.g. have a character vector containing numbers that you with to do calculations with. We can use the `as.numeric()` function to convert them as in the example below. There are obviously also functions `as.character()`, `as.integer()`, `as.logical()` and more.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=TRUE, error=TRUE}
a <- c("2.48", "1.98", "5.49")
a * 2
as.numeric(a) * 2
```

### Optional exercise
What happens when you try to mix variable types? Play around with the following code - what happens if you run `as.numeric()`?

```{r mixedtypes, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
(a <- c("-.1"," 2.7 ","B", TRUE))
```


## Functions and arguments

In addition to simple math, R can use *functions* to manipulate objects. We have actually already seen some functions, e.g. `c()` and `seq()` that we used to create vectors. A function usually takes a number of arguments as input between the parantheses, and then gives an output. If you don't know how to specify the arguments to a function you can enter `?` followed by the function name (eg. `?seq`) in the console and read the documentation. Other examples of simple functions are `sqrt()` to calculate the square-root of a number, and `mean()` which takes a vector and calculates the mean.

### Exercise 3
Calculate the square-root of `a` and the mean of `b` below.

```{r functions, exercise = TRUE}
a <- 3.141592
b <- c(2.83, 4.85, 1.39, 8.01)

```

```{r functions-solution}
a <- 3.141592
sqrt(a)
b <- c(2.83, 4.85, 1.39, 8.01)
mean(b)
```

## Data frames and tidy data
Often we have some data, where for each observation we have recorded several values of interest. The most straight-forward way to store such data is in a data-frame (or a tibble as it is also called). The data can be stored in a *tidy* format as illustrated below for the easiest access and manipulation. 

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

* Each variable must have its own column.
* Each observation must have its own row.
* Each value must have its own cell.

![](images/tidy-1.png)

Dataframes in R can be constructed using the `tibble()` function. It is part of the *tidyverse* package, so we need to load that first.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

df <- tibble(name = c("Emil", "Anders"),
             age = c(27, 27),
             height = c(170, 175),
             postcode = c(8000, 8000),
             edu = c("Nanoscience", "Medicine"))
df
```

As you can see, we can easily organise our data in a tibble. From the output you can see the data-type of each column. We can access columns (`$`) or single values (`[]`), apply functions etc:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
df$name
df$edu[1]
sum(df$age)
```

A small dataframe like this is easy to handle, but often you will have many variables and observations. R has various functions for easily getting an overview of a dataframe.

### Exercise 4
A built-in example of a large dataset is called `diamonds`, and contains information about the price and quality of 53940 diamonds. Try using the functions `head()`, `summary()`, `str()` and `glimpse()` to gain information about the dataset.

```{r dataframe, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
diamonds
```
